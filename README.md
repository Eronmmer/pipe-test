# Table Builder

- **Demo**: https://erons-pipe.netlify.app/

Could you imagine a more interesting way to quickly build customizable views of various database tables? ðŸ˜ƒ Well, be my guest.

You select the columns you want to be displayed, filter numeric data and I make sure your data conforms to the rules you specify.

There's no catch: That's simply just it :).

Here's a quick breakdown of what you can do with this pretty little app.

- You can select at least one column to add from the list of available options on the left.

- You can filter some numeric data: Term Length, MRR and Invoice Number

- You can export your current config/setting as JSON and import it later to continue right from where you stopped!
