# Table Builder

- **Demo**: https://erons-pipe.netlify.app/

Could you imagine a more interesting way to quickly build customizable views of various database tables? ðŸ˜ƒ Well, be my guest.

You select the columns you want to be displayed, filter numeric data and I make sure your data conforms to the rules you specify.

There's no catch: That's simply just it :).

Here's a quick breakdown of what you can do with this pretty little app.

- You can select at least one column to add from the list of available options on the left.

![Columns](/public/columns.jpg)

- You can filter some numeric data: Term Length, MRR and Invoice Number

![Filter](/public/2.jfif)

- You can export your current config/setting as JSON and import it later to continue right from where you stopped!

## Extras

- You can deselect a column by clicking on it again. As for the last 3 numeric columns, you have to click on the text i.e(MRR, Invoice Number or Term Length) to deselect. Clicking on the filter button will only open a filter modal where you can clear or save a filter.
- During importation, the JSON string is thoroughly validated and parsed to ensure that the right string exported from the app initially was used.
- You can copy the content of the Table Config to the clipboard by just clicking on a button
- You get a 'no match found message' when none of the data in visible columns match your filter
